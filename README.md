# Super Mario RL Project

![Super Mario RL](images/mario.gif)

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing reinforcement learning algorithms to train agents in the Super Mario Gym environment. The goal is to create an intelligent agent that can navigate and complete levels in the Super Mario environment using RL techniques dealing with the sparse environment problem.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**: Implement and experiment with various RL algorithms such as Sarsa, Double Deep Q-learning, A3C.
- **Super Mario Gym Environment**: Utilize the OpenAI Gym environment for Super Mario, providing a realistic simulation for training and evaluating the agent.
- **Visualization**: Include visualizations and graphs to demonstrate the learning progress of the agent over time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Dependencies OpenAI Gym, PyTorch

### Installation
